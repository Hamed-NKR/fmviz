    <p>
      The primary function of any mask is to filter particle contaminants out of air as it passes
      through the mask, which is relevant to preventing the spread of the COVID-19
      and other respiratory diseases. Filtration occurs as a result of several mechanisms, including
      <b>impaction</b>, <b>interception</b>, <b>diffusion</b>,
      and <b>electrostatic attraction</b>.
    </p>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <img src="imgs/01_schem.svg" style="max-width:800px;width:100%;padding-top:10px;"></img>
    </div>

    <p>
      Impaction tends to dominate for larger particles,
      while diffusion is most significant for smaller particles. Electrostatic charges
      in the mask, as are typically present in N95-compliant masks, tend to enhance
      particle filtration but also tend to hold up rather poorly when the mask
      is sanitized. For example, washing most N95-compliant masks with soap and water
      will significantly reduces their filtration properties.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="main">

    <h2>FILTRATION V. PRESSURE DROP</h2>

    <p>
      This first viz examines the filtration properties of common materials, using the data from
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06001">Rogak et al</a>. In addition to filtration,
      this viz considers the effect of a second important property: <b>pressure drop</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pressure drop denotes resistance and is one of the other common
      parameters reported in testing face masks. Lower pressure drops are preferable
      in that they make for a more breathable mask and result in less
      leakage around the mask.

      A good mask has a balance of both of these properties. The following plot considers
      these properties for some common materials. Uncertainties in this data are generally larger for low
      fitration efficiencies (negative filtration efficiencies occasionally reflect this; they
      are artifacts of the measurements and are not physical).
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout this web app, materials are coded according to their
      structure, number of layers, and treatment. For example, a code
      denoting a knit material that has been laundered multiple times is
      <b>K4x4 WDx4</b>.
    </p>

    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        Expanding on the various components of this code:
      </p>

      <p>
        1. The first letter or pair of letters generally denotes the material structure,
        using <b>W</b> for woven materials, <b>K</b> for knit materials,
        <b>CP</b> for cut pile materials (e.g., corduroy), and <b>nW</b> for non-woven
        materials. Composite masks, such as the N95-compliant materials tested,
        have different codes (e.g., <b>ASTM</b> for surgical masks that adhere to the
        ASTM standard).

        The different material structures can added or removed from the plot using the
        checkboxes in the controls above the first plot.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. The second component is a number used to identify the different
        materials within a given material structure. As the number is only
        used to identify the material, it does not contain any information
        about the material makeup or structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Next, some codes append <b>x*</b> to denote if multiple layers
        were used during the test. For example <b>K4x2</b> is four layers of
        the K4 material (Double-knit jersey, yellow). If the <b>x*</b>
        component is missing, a single layer of the material was used.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. Finally, some codes append a space followed by a code denoting if
        a sanitization treatment was applied to the material. Examples include,
        <b>HS</b> for heat treatment, <b>IPA</b> for isopropyl alcohol treatments,
        <b>WD</b> for laundering, and <b>SW</b> for washing with soap and water.
        If no such code is appended, the material is in its original condition.
        If santization was repeatedly applied, this latter part of the code
        will also be appended with <b>x*</b> (e.g., <b>WDx10</b> denotes
        materials laundered ten times).
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      We occasionally characterize the materials by their colour, as there is often
      limited information available about the specific material properties (thread count).
      Instead, the range of similar materials is ued to indicate the potential spread
      of filtration and pressure drop that could be associated with a
      type of material.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the plot below, dashed lines correspond to line of constant quality, using
      the natural number as a base ane pressures in kPa. A good (or high) quality denotes a
      hybrid of good filtration while maintaining a lower pressure drop. Masks with
      the highest quality in this study include N95-compliant and surgical masks.
      For more details on the precise interpretation of quality we refer the reader
      to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06001">Rogak et al.</a> and the references
      therein.

    <h2>SIZE-RESOLVED MASK FILTRATION</h2>

    <p>
      Not all particle sizes are filtered in the same way. For example, small particles
      tend to pass through masks more easily, resulting in lower filtration efficiencies.
      This second viz examines the size-resolved mask filtration data. Generally, points higher on
      the plot are preferred, through, these materials may result in an unreasonable pressure
      drops that make the mask uncomfortable to wear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the curves all have a similar trend, where the filtration
      efficiency decreases as the particles get smaller (to the left).
      The most penetrating particle size (MPPS), that is, the minimum
      in these kinds of curves, typically occurs in the 50-500 nm range and
      is the focus of several other similar studies (see references in
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06001">Rogak et al.</a>). Here we
      focus on the larger particles, which remain relevant for bioaerosol applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this plot, the black, dashed line indicates an
      estimate of the filtration expected for a multi-layered mask,
      which can include up to <b>three layers</b>, as selected using the
      dropdown boxes below.

      Estimates for multi-layered masks are only <i>approximate</i>, computed using
      the product of filtration efficiencies for individual layers.
      This also gives no indication of the feasibility of the different layers,
      as they do not have a standardized weight or pressure drop. We again refer
      the interested reader to
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06001">Rogak et al.</a>
      for a more detailed discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coloured lines indicate individual filter layers, which can be added,
      removed, or changed using the dropdown boxes. The colours themselves
      correspond to the material classes shown in the plot above (for example,
      yellow is for knitted materials).
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that some materials contribute very little to the filtration properties but
      may have other advantages, such as absorbing moisture inside the mask.

      We also note that the focus of this data was also on
      the <b>materials</b> themselves. As such, these curves do not consider
      leakage around the mask, which is another important feature in
      constructing an effective mask.
