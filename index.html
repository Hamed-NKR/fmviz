    </div>

    <p>
      The primary function of any mask is to filter particles out of the air that passes
      through the mask, which is relevant to preventing the spread of the COVID-19
      and other respiratory diseases. Filtration occurs as a result of several mechanisms, including
      <b>impaction</b>, <b>interception</b>, <b>diffusion</b>,
      and <b>electrostatic attraction</b>.
    </p>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <img src="imgs/01_schem.svg" style="max-width:800px;width:100%;padding-top:10px;"></img>
    </div>

    <p>
      Impaction tends to dominate for larger particles,
      while diffusion is most significant for smaller particles. Electrostatic charges
      in the mask, as are typically present in N95-compliant masks, tend to enhance
      particle filtration but also tend to hold up rather poorly when the mask
      is sanitized. For example, washing most N95-compliant masks with soap and water
      will significantly reduces their filtration properties.

    <h2>FILTRATION & PRESSURE DROP</h2>

    <p>
      This first graphic uses data from
      <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a>
      to examine the filtration properties of face masks alongside a
      second important property: <b>pressure drop</b>.
      Filtration has rather intuitive consequences for face masks. If a face
      masks has poor filtration properties, particles (perhaps containing virus) are allowed to
      pass through the fabric and reach the wearer, reducing the utility
      of the mask.
      The consequences of a poor pressure drop are less direct.
      Pressure drop denotes resistance. In this respect,
      a low pressure drop is preferable for two reasons. It (1) makes
      for a more breathable mask, which is less likely to irritate the wearer, and
      (2) results in less leakage around the mask, improving
      the overall utility of the mask.
    </p>

    <p>
      A good mask has a balance of both of these properties. The following plot considers
      these properties for some common materials. Uncertainties in the data are generally larger for low
      fitration efficiencies (negative filtration efficiencies occasionally reflect this; they
      are artifacts of the measurements and are not physical).
      Generally materials in the upper-left region of the plot (high filtration, low pressure drop)
      are the best. N95 masks are located on the upper axis,
      effectively filtering 100% of particles at these sizes.
    </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ Why are some of the materials identified by their physcial colour?</button>
    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        We occasionally characterize the materials by their physical colour. This is
        done as there is often limited information available about the specific material properties (e.g., thread count).
        In this regard, the colour is simply used to denote different materials within
        a similar material class.

        Accordingly, this data should be interpretted as indicating the potential variability
        of filtration and pressure drop that could be associated with a given
        type of material.
      </p>

      <p>
        A pertinent example is the knit cottons, which have variable quality
        despite being a similar material by the consumer.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ What do the dashed lines in the figure represent? The short answer: quality.</button>
    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        In the plot below, dashed lines correspond to line of constant <b>quality</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A good (or high) quality denotes a hybrid of good filtration
        while maintaining a low pressure drop. Infinite quality would correspond
        to a material that filters all of the particles, with no pressure drop.
        Naturally, real materials have trouble realizing this ideal. Masks with
        the highest quality in this study include N95-compliant and surgical masks.
        N95-compliant masks in some cases essentially blocked 100% of particles
        (within the limits of the current measurement apparatus), such that the quality approached ∞.
        Calculations use the natural number as a base and pressures in kPa.
        For more details on how quality is defined and what it means, we refer the reader
        to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a> and the references
        therein.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ What do the extra letters in brackets mean (e.g., W5)?</button>
    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        Simply put, these are codes we assign to each case, composed of characters
        identifying a material, its structure, number of layers used during measurement,
        and treatment applied (e.g., laundered), if any. In most instances, the reader can
        ignore these codes.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those more interested in these codes, we expand the various components:
      </p>

      <ol class="collapsible-ol">
        <li>
          The first letter or pair of letters generally denotes the material structure,
          using <b>W</b> for woven materials, <b>K</b> for knit materials,
          <b>CP</b> for cut pile materials (e.g., corduroy), and <b>nW</b> for non-woven
          materials. Composite masks, such as the N95-compliant materials tested,
          have different codes (e.g., <b>ASTM</b> for surgical masks that adhere to the
          ASTM standard).

          The different material structures can added or removed from the plot using the
          checkboxes in the controls above the first plot.
        </li>

        <li>
          The second component is a number used to identify the different
          materials within a given material structure. As the number is only
          used to identify the material, it does not contain any information
          about the material makeup or structure.
        </li>

        <li>
          Next, some codes append <b>x*</b> to denote if multiple layers
          were used during the test. For example <b>K4x2</b> is four layers of
          the K4 material (Double-knit jersey, yellow). If the <b>x*</b>
          component is missing, a single layer of the material was used.
        </li>

        <li>
          Finally, some codes append a space followed by a code denoting if
          a sanitization treatment was applied to the material. Examples include,
          <b>HS</b> for heat treatment, <b>IPA</b> for isopropyl alcohol treatments,
          <b>WD</b> for laundering, and <b>SW</b> for washing with soap and water.
          If no such code is appended, the material is in its original condition.
          If santization was repeatedly applied, this latter part of the code
          will also be appended with <b>x*</b> (e.g., <b>WDx10</b> denotes
          materials laundered ten times).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For example, a code
        denoting a knit material that has been laundered multiple times is
        <b>K4x4 WDx4</b>. A list of the codes is included in the table at the bottom
        of this page.

    <h2>DESIGN YOUR OWN MASK</h2>

    <h3>Considering size-resolved, multi-layer mask filtration.</h3>

    <p>
      Not all particle sizes are filtered in the same way. For example, small particles
      tend to pass through masks more easily, resulting in lower filtration efficiencies.
      This second viz examines the size-resolved mask filtration of the data from
      <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al</a>.
      Generally, curves higher on the plot are preferred, through, these materials
      may result in an unreasonable pressure drops that make the mask uncomfortable to wear
      and lead to larger amounts of leakage.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, this viz is used to estimate the filtration properties of
      masks composed of multiple layers.
      In this regard, solid, coloured lines indicate individual filter layers, while
      the black, dashed line corresponds to an estimate combining all of the
      selected feature layers.
      Estimates for multi-layered masks are only <b>approximate</b>, computed using
      the product of the particle penetration for individual layers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Individual feature layers can be added,
      removed, or changed using the dropdown boxes and
      can include up to <b>three layers</b>, the number recommended by the WHO.
    </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ Do all of the curves have a similar trend?</button>
    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        It is well-established that the filtration
        efficiency consistently decreases as the particles get smaller (to the left)
        for this size range.
        The most penetrating particle size (MPPS), that is, the minimum
        in these kinds of curves, typically occurs in the 50-500 nm range and
        is the focus of several other similar studies (see references in
        <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a>). Here we
        focus on the larger particles, which remain relevant for bioaerosol applications.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ Are all of these mask combinations realistic?</button>
    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        Not necessarily! This viz does not give an indication of the feasibility of the different layers,
        as they do not have a standardized weight, pressure drop, thickness, or compatibility.
        We again refer the interested reader to
        <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1855321">Rogak et al. (2021)</a>
        for a more detailed discussion.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ What do the line colours in this viz represent?</button>
    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        The colours of the solid lines
        correspond to the material classes for the individual filter layers,
        with the same colours as those used in the previous viz (for example,
        yellow is for knitted materials).
      </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ Why might one consider the poor filter layers?</button>
    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        While some materials contribute very little to the filtration properties, they
        may have other advantages. For example, some layers may absorb moisture.
        However, it is important that these layer do not add a lot of pressure drop
        to the mask, for reasons noted above.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ What about leakage around the mask?</button>
    <div class="text-indent">
      <p>
        We note that the focus of this data is on
        the <b>materials</b> themselves. As such, these curves <b>do not</b> consider
        leakage around the mask. This is another very important feature in
        constructing an effective masks but requires different kinds of
        tests that are wearer-specific. There are other studies by other
        aerosol researchers and health professionals considering this
        aspect of mask construction.
